## 🎯 How It Works

### For Beginners:

1. **React Components**: This app uses React, which means the UI is divided into small, reusable components.

2. **Vite**: This is a very fast build tool. When you run `npm run dev`, Vite will:

   - Start development server
   - Enable Hot Module Replacement (HMR) - meaning code changes are instantly visible without refresh
   - Bundle all files for production

3. **ESLint**: A tool to maintain code quality by detecting errors and enforcing coding standards.

## 🛠️ Customization

### Changing CV Content:

1. Open the file containing CV data (usually in `src/data/` or directly in components)
2. Update personal information, experience, skills, etc.
3. Save the file - changes will be instantly visible in the browser

## 🚀 Deployment

### Deploy to Vercel (Recommended):

1. Push your code to GitHub
2. Connect repository to [Vercel](https://vercel.com)
3. Vercel will automatically build and deploy

### Deploy to Netlify:

1. Run `npm run build`
2. Upload the `dist/` folder to [Netlify](https://netlify.com)

### Manual Deployment:

```bash
npm run build
# Upload contents of dist/ folder to your web server
```
